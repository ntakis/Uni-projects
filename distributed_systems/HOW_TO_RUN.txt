MASTER:
Just run main method.
Master System requires all files except from DummyUser.java, Worker.java, StatPrinter.java and MappingThread.java

WORKER:
args[0] = IP_ADDRESS
Worker System requires Worker.java, GPXPacket.java, GPXPoint.java and MappingThread.java files.

(DUMMY) USER:
args[0] = route file number e.x. for args[0] = 1, if "route1" file is located at System.getProperty("user.dir")
it sends it.
args[1] = IP_ADDRESS
(Dummy) User system requires DummyUser.java and StatPrinter.java files.

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Each user can only send one file at a time, meaning that in order for the same user to send a second gpx file
for processing he has to wait until he receives the results from the first one.

ABOUT THE GLOBAL USER ACTIVITY STATS:
There is an attempt to update the global user stats every x seconds (currently set at 5 seconds) by the global
activity stats updater. The user won't receive a real-time updated global_stats file but will receive a file that
was updated x seconds before which means the global_stats file won't factor in his last request's results.

Also, if the Master system stops operating immediately after results have been sent to a user, then the global
activity stats updater won't have enough time to update the global_stats file and the global_stats file will contain
innacurate data. An assumption is made that the Main.java method will keep running after a request has been completed
for at least another 5 seconds.

ABOUT CHUNK_SIZE:
We made the choice of size 10 gpx chunks, this can easily be changed from the ResultReducer CHUNK_SIZE variable.

ABOUT SENDING GPX CHUNKS FROM DIFFERENT GPX FILES AT THE SAME TIME:
There can be up to 5 active threads sending gpx chunks from a different gpx file, this option can be changed
by adjusting the variable SENDER_LIMIT of the TaskAssigner class.

ABOUT THE RESULTS THE USER RECEIVES:
In the user system 3 different temporary files* are stored, their contents are printed in a human friendly way
using the StatPrinter class and then they are deleted. If they need be stored inside the user's system then 
that can easily be changed. Για τη διευκόλυνση του εξεταστή επιλέξαμε τη μέθοδο αυτή προς το παρών.

* temporary file names: username_temp_user_route_stats, username_temp_total_route_stats, username_temp_global_stats

ADDITIONAL NOTE: The gpx files the master receives are also deleted after being parsed, this can also easily change
if need be.
